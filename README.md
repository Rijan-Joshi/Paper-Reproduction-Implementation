##  ✨ Latest Implementation: LeNet-5 (LeCun et al., 1998)
### *This implementation is a full-scratch build, using only NumPy for all the operations, layers, optimizations, activations, and everything else. This required manual derivation and implementation of the forward and backward passes for every single layer.*


## 📖 About This Repository
This repository documents my journey of **implementing, replicating, and experimenting** with seminal Deep Learning papers and architectures from scratch.

**The Goal:** To demystify the "black box" of neural networks.
## 📜 The Rule
> ***No pre-built model imports (e.g., torchvision.models). Every layer, training loop, and architecture is built from the ground up to understand the internal mechanics. Implementations will use either:** <br><br>  1. **NumPy:** For true, low-level mathematical implementation of all operations (convolution, backprop, optimizers, etc.). <br><br> 2. **PyTorch Tensors:** For high-level implementations leveraging CUDA and automatic differentiation where desired.*

## 🗓️ The Schedule
I commit to adding a new implementation **every Friday**.
