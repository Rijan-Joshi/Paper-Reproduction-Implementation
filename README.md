## 📖 About This Repository
This repository documents my journey of **implementing, replicating, and experimenting** with seminal Deep Learning papers and architectures from scratch.

**The Goal:** To demystify the "black box" of neural networks.
## 📜 The Rule
_No pre-built model imports (e.g., torchvision.models). Every layer, training loop, and architecture is built from the ground up to understand the internal mechanics. Implementations will use either:

NumPy: For true, low-level mathematical implementation of all operations (convolution, backprop, optimizers).

PyTorch Tensors: For high-level implementations leveraging CUDA and automatic differentiation where desired._

## 🗓️ The Schedule
I commit to adding a new implementation **every Friday**.
